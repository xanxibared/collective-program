# Translations Initiative

Welcome to the Bloom Translations Initiative, a place where community members can help expand the reach of Bloom educational resources by translating them into various languages.

## Project Snapshot

- Earn bounties in Dai
- Make Bloom & Dai more accessible

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Bloom is an inherently global platform, which facilitates the creation of BloomIDs and their corresponding features. As Bloom and BLT spread across the world, our focus is on creating more secure, decentralized identities and providing individuals with more inclusive credit scores. With inclusivity as a foundational part of our culture, our goal is to translate our current resources into as many languages as possible. Through the Translations Initiative, we are working to grant wider audiences access to materials about Bloom in their native languages.

## Project Description

This is a community-led initiative that uses Dai bounties to incentivize users to translate Bloom resources to their native languages.

## Is this for me?

Maybe! You must be:

- Fluent
- Bilingual
- Primary languages: Portuguese, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, Mandarin, German, Italian, and French
- Basic knowledge of Bloom
- Basic familiarity with markdown

Then this is definitely for you!
