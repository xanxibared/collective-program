# DIY Community Meetups

Welcome to Do It Yourself Bloom Community Meetups, a place where you can find all the resources you need to host your very own meetup.

## Project Snapshot

- Bring together your local community
- Get funding in Dai (stablecoin)
- Create learning opportunities around Bloom

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Bloom is only as strong as its community. By hosting a meetup in your area, you can help develop a local community that is passionate about Bloom, the protocol, and the ecosystem that is being built around it. Through the meetups project, we seek to:

- Give the Bloom community the resources they need to organize successful meetups
- Develop a grassroots movement that educates, inspires, and grows the Bloom ecosystem and community
- Encourage local Bloom communities to collaborate on projects on top of the Bloom Protocol and BLT

## Project Description

This program is a major Bloom initiative. We offer a [micro-granting](./requesting-funds.md) program to help fund local community meetups.

Additionally, we're working with the community to actively develop a collection of guides to help you, even if you've never planned an event before. Currently, these include a [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started-guide.md), [Budget Guide](./budget-guide.md), [Promotion Guide](./promotion-guide.md), and an [Event Formats Guide](event-formats-guide.md).

## Is this for me?

### Hosting Meetups

Do you enjoy hosting events and bringing people together? We're eager to support people who want to build the Bloom community together in their city.

### I...

- Am passionate about Bloom and its use cases
- Have access to a community of people
- Have the ability to organize and host an event

### Contribute to the Hosting Guides

Not in a position to host? No problem. We're constantly looking to improve the quality of our Hosting Guides.

- Prior hosting experience is a plus, but not necessary
- Experience in writing or editing is recommended

## How do I get involved?

Ready to start planning your meetup? We've created a [guide](./getting-started-guide.md) to help you get started.

## Status

Micro-grant [applications](https://forms.gle/H2PCdJR7MXQjhyBbA) are open.

## Important Disclaimer

These meetups are **not for speculating on the price of the token or general hype.** The main goal of hosting meetups is to bring people together and educate them about Bloom, the protocol, use cases, and help people create a BloomID using the iOS or Android apps. When talking about the BLT token, the goal should be to educate the attendees about the purpose and utility of the token. Presentations can focus on the Bloom ecosystem, how Bloom and BLT interact with the protocol and pay for transactions, protocol votes, or other relevant topics.
