# Grants Program

The Bloom Collective grants program is designed to directly support projects that increase Bloom protocol and Bloom Token (BLT) adoption, support emerging economies, open up new markets, provide novel uses for the stablecoin, or otherwise further the principles of the Bloom protocol. We allocate grants in the range of $250 - $10,000 U.S. Dollars, distributed in Dai (a stablecoin pegged to multiple fiat currencies). We distribute blocks of funds as grantees reach predetermined milestones.

We like to think of our grantees as highly self-directed remote individuals or teams. Therefore the model we use to incubate our grants require regular check-ins, operational transparency, high developer velocity, active repositories, and regular communications with Bloom. How well grantees meet these requirements will determine if a milestone has been reached and whether additional funds will be released.

We are interested in a wide range of projects but our current focus is primarily around novel, usable tools that directly benefit BloomID holders, and increase Bloom protocol & BLT adoption. Pure research & development, information gathering, additional runway, or Ethereum ecosystem improvements are generally outside the scope of the program. We also do not allocate grants that contain large marketing budgets and/or BLT giveaways and airdrops. Because the program is based on milestones, grants are expected to fund specific feature-sets.

As part of the application process, Bloom will ask for a clearly written, one or two-page explanation outlining exactly what the app does, the problem it solves, why it will be successful, and a rough projected budget. After the initial review, we may also request links to demos, architecture diagrams, flows that show how BLT is used, use cases, competitive analysis, source code, etc.

Our grants program is designed to allow teams to achieve a successful release of their passion project. Due to the high volume of worthy requests we receive and the limited resources available, we prioritize applications that have conservative budgets.

Grantees that successfully complete their milestones and launch a product may also gain access to internal Bloom resources. These can take many forms from code reviews and external security audits, to consultations with Legal, Public Relations and/or Business Development teams. Successful projects will also be prioritized for continued granting and or possible investments from Bloom in future iterations of the program.

## Grant Ideas:

- Build a BloomID authentication module for Particl

- Build a BloomID authentication module for Colony
  - https://github.com/joincolony/purser
- Build a BloomID authentication module for HR apps
  - Use cases include onboarding new employees, assigning role-based access to the HR system, and others
- Build a BloomID authentication for use within UniversalLogin
  - https://github.com/universallogin
- Build a module to authenticate BloomID public keys on Matrix-based servers (e.g. Riot.im)
  - https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1768
  - http://www.openintents.org/blog/2019/01/12/getting-rid-of-passwords.html
- Stand-alone Apps
  - Simple age checking app (e.g. for bars, nightclubs and restaurants)
    - A bouncer/door person would display a QR code on a device; the customer would scan the QR code and share their name and age; the bouncer would receive a successful verification on their device
  - KYC/identity verification for ICOs and/or applying for jobs
    - Grantees can use https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter as a codebase

## Applying

Projects that propose novel and usable tools that directly benefit the Bloom protocol, or use Bloom's protocol and/or BLT, are invited to [fill out and submit an application](https://forms.gle/ZjZcWZJ9SmjfLYEv9) that outlines *what the project/app does*, how it works, the problem it solves, and a projected budget. Please remember, we prioritize applications that have conservative budgets.
