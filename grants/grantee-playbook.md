# Bloom Collective Grantee Playbook

This document outlines list of very basic best practices our grantees are encouraged to follow. Please take a close look; **how well your team completes this checklist will used to determine whether milestones have been hit**, and will contribute to the future relationship your organization has with Bloom.

## Socials

Cross-promotion is important when getting the word out about the cool projects you are working on. Please follow, like, add, clap, upvote, etc., when your fellow teams publish something.

This increased visibility will allow Bloom to form PR plans around notable events and product launches.

- Set up a Twitter handle for your team
- Try to maintain at least weekly activity on the account
  - Follow projects in your space
  - Follow other grantees
  - Identify influencers who might be interested in your project and add them
  - Post links to your blog posts, repos, etc

## Source Code

- Ensure that all work is being regularly committed to a repo
  - Regularly track and close issues, PRs, etc
- Add [@dereksilva](https://github.com/dereksilva) and [@ipatka](https://github.com/ipatka) to the repo if it's private
- Create a top level README.md which contains a detailed description of the project, goals, features, roadmap, installation instructions
- **The Collective team will primarily be watching activity in grantee repos to measure project velocity**

## Dev Posts

- Each project needs a dedicated blog. WordPress, Devpost, Medium, and Ghost are good options.
- Set up a reminder to write a dev post **at least once a month, or once per milestone,** outlining the progress/challenges/wins, your team has encountered. Include links to repos, demos, social media
  - Look at these examples by grantees from other programs for inspiration: [here](https://medium.com/@david.brian.ethier/did-crypto-just-become-useful-34d9804d5b5d), [here](https://medium.com/gitcoin/ethereum-in-emerging-economies-b235f8dac2f2), and [here](https://medium.com/daipos/every-day-crypto-with-xdai-a832b051a65)
  - [**This**](https://twitter.com/austingriffith/status/1081212830525808640) **is an effective release promotion.**

## Chats

- All grantee team members should be in the [Bloom Telegram](https://t.me/bloomprotocol) group. Ask questions here, brainstorm ideas, talk about the protocol, etc. The people who built the core Bloom ecosystem are all in there, and available for questions and ideation.
- Grantees that succeed and are selected for additional grants may be invited to a private Slack channel with the core Bloom team.
- Please post all status updates, tweets, questions in the Telegram group and [Bloom's subreddit](https://bloomtoken.reddit.com) so other grantees and community members can jam on whatever is happening and share social media love.

## Evaluating Grantee Success

These will be the overarching categories of KPIs the participants will be expected to follow in order to hit milestones and release the next block of allocated funds:

- Ability to follow the framework, i.e. this, and other requirements docs
- Interacting with, and helping out, other grantees
- Maintaining visibility and velocity in social media and in repos
- Being able to reference a list of commits or issues that complete roadmap items
- Hitting milestones in a reasonable amount of time
- Launching a product
