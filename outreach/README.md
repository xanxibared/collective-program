# App Integration Outreach

A key part of the Bloom protocol's growth is attracting the developers of other products and solutions to integrate the protocol whether it be for user authentication, financial data aggregation, the usage of Bloom's credit scores, or other use cases. Below are a variety of ways to reach out to developers and introduce them to the Bloom protocol.

### Broad Introduction

Hi [Name],

I saw the latest news about [product/service/latest update]. I am really excited about your mission of building a decentralized [insert].

I would love to connect and hear more about what the product development roadmap looks like for the next few months. Have you guys looked into decentralized identity yet?  

If so, have you looked at BloomID [https://bloom.co/docs/]? Bloom’s protocol has enabled well over 750,000 people all around the world like me to share and store data securely, access a lending marketplace, and a hack monitoring service.

On behalf of Bloom, I know they would like to talk about the possibility of offering users new to your app the ability to authenticate with their BloomID. You can use it to access user data needed for KYC regulations, or to allow them to sign up almost anonymously using the protocol.

Bloom has seen integrations go live with Bounty0x and INK Protocol recently, with more on the way.

Would love to hear where you guys are at, and if I can introduce you to someone at Bloom.

Best,

[YOUR NAME]

On behalf of Bloom, I know they would like to talk about the possibility of offering users new to your app the ability to authenticate with their BloomID. You can use it to access user data needed for KYC regulations, free of charge, rather than pay for traditional ID verification services for every new user.
