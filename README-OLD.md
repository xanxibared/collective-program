This project is community oriented, and should thusly grow from it's core base. Bloom will empower community members, through its Ambassador Program, to inform others on why a decentralized identity powered by the Bloom protocol is a core part of their future.

The Community Development Kit will:
- Outline the uses of the protocol
- Outline use cases of the web and mobile dApps
- Provide information on what types of enterprises could benefit from building on the Bloom protocol
- Provide information on what type of enterprises could help make it stronger
- Remind the people of the vision of extending credit to systems where people are being excluded or underserved

We will empower the community by setting initiatives that the community could take on their own. Similar to that of Simple Developer Kits, the Community Development Kit will empower Ambassadors with information and material needed to allow them to start meetups/groups or to send to loved ones. This information will help people register and get excited about Bloom. It will incentivize the community through referral programs, Bloom branded merchandise, and more.

If Bloom spreads via community engagement, and can demonstrate the real benefits and use cases for creating a BloomID, we can encourage further adoption across enterprise and consumers.
