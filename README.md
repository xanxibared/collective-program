# Bloom Collective

The Bloom Collective's mandate is to directly foster the growth of the Bloom protocol ecosystem by incentivizing our most motivated members. We do this through a series of initiatives that encourage people to participate in, and contribute to, the success of the Bloom protocol.

## Collective Tiers

The Collective members are broken up into three tiers based on their activity and contributions. The tiers are:

- Agent
- Envoy
- Deputy

As Collective members host events, translate documents, and contribute in other ways to promoting the Bloom protocol, they will earn reputation in the [Bloom Collective's Colony](https://colony.io/colony/bloomcollective).

## Our Initiatives

### [Community Meetup Grants](meetups/README.md)

Collective members play an invaluable role in building a stronger Bloom ecosystem. The Collective program wants to provide the resources needed to increase Bloom protocol awareness and adoption, bringing identity security and financial inclusion to the world through BloomID and Bloom's software development kits. To accomplish these goals, we created a 'Do It Yourself' Meetup guide and microgranting program dedicated to helping anyone create and organize a local community meetup.

### [Community Translations](translations/README.md)

We bring Bloom's educational content to people around the world in their native languages by incentivizing our community of content translators with Dai bounties.

### [Development Grants Program](grants/README.md)

The Bloom Development Grants program provides funding for projects that increase Bloom protocol adoption, support emerging economies, open new markets, provide novel uses for the protocol and BloomIDs, or otherwise further the principles of the Bloom protocol.

### [Contributing](contributing/README.md)

If you have any suggestions about how you think these initiatives should work, could be improved, or if you are interested in helping out, please join our [Telegram](https://t.me/bloomprotocol) group and introduce yourself. We may invite you to our [Colony](https://bloomcollective.colony.joincolony.eth).
