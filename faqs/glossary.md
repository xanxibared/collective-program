## [BloomID](bloomid)

BloomID is a reusable and cryptographically secure digital identity that allows users to control their own data.  Bloom enables users to control and protect their data, determining exactly with whom and when to share verified information. You choose what to include in your identity and our providers verify the authenticity of your information.

## [BloomIQ](bloomiq)

BloomIQ is a system for reporting and tracking current and historical debt obligations that are tied to a user’s BloomID. BloomIQ is designed to bring the wealth of pre-existing and comprehensive credit history to the blockchain while maintaining privacy for individuals. This is achieved by introducing a permission-based data sharing system, offering a marked improvement over current systems. Data about an individual’s ability to pay past debts remains an important part of determining credit risk, and BloomIQ enables this functionality to be decentralized and reusable.

## [BloomScore](bloomscore)

BloomScore is a dynamic and inclusive indicator of an individual's likelihood to pay debts that adapts to the maturity of a user's credit history. The initial Bloom release computes a simple score based on past debt obligations and payment history. Each phase is scored differently in order to optimally fit the information available. This phased approach ensures that new and long-time users are treated appropriately, instead of 18 year olds and 99 year olds being scored using the same scoring system.

## [Attestation](attestation)

Attestation can be defined as the act or instance of attesting something such as:

- proving of the existence of something through evidence
- an official verification of something as true or authentic
- the proof or evidence by which something (such as the usage of a word) is attested

Attestors validate to a data recipient that the data a BloomID holder has verified is valid, and therefore attests to the validity and veracity of the data being shared.
