## GENERAL

**Q:** What is Bloom?
Bloom is an end-to-end protocol for identity attestation, risk assessment and credit scoring built on the Ethereum blockchain. Bloom allows both traditional and digital currency lenders to serve billions of people who currently cannot obtain a bank account or credit score.

**Q:** What is BloomID?
BloomID is a reusable and cryptographically secure digital identity that allows users to control their own data.  Bloom enables users to control and protect their data, determining exactly with whom and when to share verified information. You choose what to include in your identity and our providers verify the authenticity of your information.

**Q:** What is BloomIQ?
BloomIQ is a system for reporting and tracking current and historical debt obligations that are tied to a user’s BloomID. BloomIQ is designed to bring the wealth of pre-existing and comprehensive credit history to the blockchain while maintaining privacy for individuals. This is achieved by introducing a permission-based data sharing system, offering a marked improvement over current systems. Data about an individual’s ability to pay past debts remains an important part of determining credit risk, and BloomIQ enables this functionality to be decentralized and reusable.

**Q:** What is BloomScore and how does it work?
BloomScore is a dynamic and inclusive indicator of an individual's likelihood to pay debts that adapts to the maturity of a user's credit history. The initial Bloom release computes a simple score based on past debt obligations and payment history. Each phase is scored differently in order to optimally fit the information available. This phased approach ensures that new and long-time users are treated appropriately, instead of 18 year olds and 99 year olds being scored using the same scoring system. For more, please see page 9 of the whitepaper (PDF): https://bloom.co/whitepaper.pdf

**Q:** What is Bloom Token and what is it for?
The Bloom utility token (BLT) allows organizations to participate in evaluating user identities and creditworthiness. It also serves as the voting token to guide the evolution of the Bloom protocol, and to pay for all transactions completed on the protocol. You can read more on the Bloom Token section of our website: https://bloom.co/token and https://bloom.co/blog/how-you-can-use-bloom-tokens.

**Q:** Where can I get more information?
You can see more on our website at https://bloom.co, the whitepaper at https://bloom.co/whitepaper.pdf, and our blog at https://bloom.co/blog.

**Q:** Which projects and companies does Bloom have partnerships with?
Bloom has multiple partnerships with lenders, banks and dapps. Some publicly announced partners include Bounty0x, INK Protocol, District0x, ETHLend, Everex, TypingID, BlockFi, SpringRole, and Karma. You can find more at partnerships at https://bloom.co/blog/tag/partner. We are continuing to work with partners that use BloomIQ, BloomScore, and BloomID as a part of their platforms. If you would like to discuss a partnership, please email team@bloom.co.

**Q:** Did Bloom have a token sale?
Yes, the Bloom token sale was held in late 2017. Any questions you have are likely answered here: https://bloom.co/blog/bloom-token-sale--recap---analysis/. If you have any further questions, please email team@bloom.co.

**Q:** Which wallets support Bloom Token?
You can use any wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens to access, send, or receive BLT. In order to use the Bloom web dApp, you must create a BloomID using the mobile app, then you can use the mobile app's QR code reader to scan the QR code at https://bloom.co/app/signin.

You can download and install our iOS and Android apps here. Our web dApp is available at https://bloom.co/app/signin. You can also check out what's been Built on Bloom: https://bloom.co/blog/tag/built-on-bloom.

**Q:** Why was my identity (ID) document not verified?
Your ID document verification may fail for a number of reasons, including:

- The photo on your ID document doesn't match the self-portrait you uploaded.
- The photo of your ID document was not clear and the data could not be read.
- You attempted to upload an unsupported document.
- You didn't upload photos of both sides, front and back, or your ID document.
- Your ID document is expired.

Here are some tips to help you get through the process:

- Ensure there is no glare or shadows over the photos
- Use high quality photos taken with a smartphone camera or DSLR; do not use a scan
- Place the ID document against a contrasting background and leave some room around the card

If the tips above do not help you, please email *censored* photos to support@bloom.co for further analysis. **Please censor any sensitive information as this will not be a manual review;** our support team will only try to determine why the data provider is not able to verify them automatically.

**Q:** What types of accounts or materials are eligible for address attestation?
Bloom's data providers support hundreds of utility companies and other firms that have verified home address data for the Address attestation. These include water, gas, and electricity utilities. If you cannot find your utility listed, then unfortunately we are not able to help you verify your address at this time. Bloom is always working on enhancing attestation availability worldwide, so we encourage you to check again every few months or when additional support is announced.
